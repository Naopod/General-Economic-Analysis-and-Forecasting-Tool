# General-Economic-Analysis-and-Forecasting-Tool

StreamLit App in the aim to centralize Economic Data about every country in the world, in order to have a complete glimpse of the economic situation of a given location, and compare between countries.

Additionnal tab is to be made, where I forecast major economic factors using (potentially) deep learning methods.

The notebook presents all the different LSTM methods (that I find interesting), and the way to code them in Pytorch (for a better handling/customization of the model, I prefer Pytorch). I test these implementations on the GDP of China.

Beginning phase !
